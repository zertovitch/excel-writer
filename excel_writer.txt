Intro to Excel Writer 
=====================
Excel Writer consists in a package, Excel_Out, which
produces Excel files (or other data streams) as simply
as this small procedure:

  with Excel_Out; use Excel_Out;
   
  procedure Small_demo is 
    xl: Excel_Out_File;
  begin 
    xl.Create("Small.xls");
    xl.Put_Line("Hello world !");
    xl.Close;
  end;

How to build and test Excel Writer
==================================
Here is how to build with GNAT/GCC (for other compilers, it
should be simple as well):
    - type "gnatmake -P excel_out_gnat.gpr" in the command line
or
    - type "gnatmake excel_out_test" in the command line
or
    - open the excel_out_gnat.gpr file with the GNAT Programming Studio (GPS),
      press F4
or
    - open excel_out_test.adb with AdaGIDE, press F3
or
    - your way...

As a result there is a excel_out_test[.exe] executable.
  
Type hierarchy
==============
  |- Excel_Out_Stream  : root type, abstract
  \
   |- Excel_Out_File   : type for writing to files (defined in Excel_Out)
   |- Excel_Out_String : type for writing to strings (defined in Excel_Out)
   |
   |- (your own stream!)

How to create properly Excel files or streams
=============================================
Most, if not all possibilities are in the Big_demo procedure
nested in Excel_Out_Test. So it is a good place to pick code...

To summarize, you need to define the spreadsheet contents in
a certain order:

1. Create

2. Optional settings, before any data output:
   | Define page layout (see Header, Footer, Page_Setup, ...)
   | Write_default_column_width
   | Write_column_width for specific columns
   | Write_default_row_height
   | Write_row_height for specific rows
   | Define_font, then Define_format

3. | Write(xl, row, column, data): row by row, column by column
   | Put(xl, data)               : same, but column is auto-incremented
   | New_Line(xl),...            : other "Text_IO"-like
   | Use_format, infuences the format of data written next

4. Close

5. (Excel_Out_String only) function Contents returns the full .xls

As you observed, you can write cell contents by setting for each cell
the target row and column, with Write, or by using Put,
Put_Line, New_Line, just like Ada.Text_IO. Both ways can be mixed
ad libitum.

Enjoy!
